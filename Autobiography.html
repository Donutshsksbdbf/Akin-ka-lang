            <p>My name is John Carlo A. Palencia, and I am currently a student pursuing a degree in Criminology. I was born on September 18, 2005 in Valenzuela City, where I grew up surrounded by a supportive family and a community that fostered my curiosity about justice and public service. Growing up, I lived in Irosin, Sorsogon, a place that shaped much of who I am today. My parents, Riel Palencia and Step Mom Jenny Alag, worked hard to provide for me and instilled in me the values of integrity, discipline, and perseverance. From an early age, I developed a deep interest in understanding the world around me, especially issues related to law, crime, and social justice. I began my education at Bulawan Elementary School, where I was an active and curious student. I enjoyed subjects like Math and Science which allowed me to think critically and develop problem-solving skills. As I progressed in school, I realized my fascination with understanding human behavior, societal rules, and the mechanisms that maintain order in our communities. This interest naturally led me to consider a career in criminology.

            After completing high school at Gabao National High School, I decided to pursue my passion and enrolled in the Criminology program at Sorsogon College of Criminology, Inc. This decision was inspired by my desire to make a positive impact in society by contributing to public safety and justice. My studies have given me the opportunity to explore topics such as criminal behavior, law enforcement, and forensic science, which have further deepened my commitment to this field. Being a criminology student has not only been academically enriching but also personally fulfilling. I have participated in activities like Community Outreach, which have allowed me to apply my knowledge in real-world situations. These experiences have taught me valuable lessons about teamwork, leadership, and the importance of empathy in understanding others. While my journey in criminology is still ongoing, I have already faced challenges that have tested my resilience and determination. Balancing academic responsibilities with personal commitments has not always been easy, but it has taught me the value of hard work and time management. I am proud of the progress I have made and the skills I have developed along the way.

            Looking ahead, my goal is to become a BFP Director, forensic investigator, or criminologist. I am passionate about contributing to a safer society by addressing the root causes of crime and helping others navigate the justice system. I believe that my education and experiences will equip me with the tools I need to achieve this dream. In conclusion, my journey as a criminology student has been a transformative experience. It has allowed me to grow both personally and professionally while working toward my aspiration of serving society. I am grateful for the support of my family, friends, and mentors, who have played a crucial role in my development. I look forward to the future with optimism and a determination to make a meaningful difference in the world. </p></p>
